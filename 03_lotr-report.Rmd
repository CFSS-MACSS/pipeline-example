This is an R Markdown document. In this example, its purpose is to allow us to demonstrate how to use `rmarkdown::render()` without the help of RStudio's buttons.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(feather)

lotr_dat <- read_feather("data/lotr_clean.feather")
```

Here is a plot we are making "on the fly" via code in an R chunk.

```{r stripplot, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(lotr_dat, aes(x = Race, y = Words)) +
  facet_wrap(~ Film) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  ggtitle("The Lord of the Rings (made from code in R Markdown") + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1/2, position = position_jitter(width = 0.1))
```

Here is a pre-made plot we are merely embedding in the compiled document.
